= `FoxHSL`
:source-highlighter: highlight.js

== Construction

This class is constructed by providing a hue, saturation, lightness, and
alpha values.

[source, python]
----
FoxHSL(0, 0.0, 0.0)
# or
FoxHSL(0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)

=== `+__init__(hue, saturation, lightness, alpha?)+`

Initializes the new FoxHSL instance with the given arguments.

.Arguments
--
[cols="2h,2m,6a"]
|===
| `hue`
| int
| Hue value as an int in the inclusive range `[0 -> 360]`.  If the given value
falls outside of that range it will be rotated back into that range keeping the
target hue selected.  This is to allow for over-rotations or negative rotations.

| `saturation`
| float
| Saturation value as a percent float in the inclusive range `[0.0 -> 1.0]`.  If
the given value falls outside of that range, an exception will be raised.

| `lightness`
| float
| Lightness value as a percent float in the inclusive range `[0.0 -> 1.0]`.  If
the given value falls outside of that range, an exception will be raised.

| `alpha`
| float
| Optional alpha value as a percent float in the inclusive range `[0.0 -> 1.0]`.
If the given value falls outside of that range, an exception will be raised.

Default = `1.0`

[#hsl-set-hue]
=== `set_hue(hue)`

Updates the target ``FoxHSL``'s hue to the given value.

.Arguments
--
[cols="2h,2m,6a"]
|===
| `hue`
| int
| New hue value to set on the target `FoxHSL` instance.  This value should be an
int in the inclusive range `[0 -> 360]`.  If it falls outside of that range, the
value will be rotated to be within that range, keeping selected hue.
